    "#    leading to improved performance for CPU-bound tasks.\n",

    "# 2. Isolation:\n",
    "#    Each process has its own memory space, preventing issues like race conditions\n",
    "#    and data corruption that can occur when threads share the same memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, multiprocessing is beneficial for achieving parallelism,\n",
